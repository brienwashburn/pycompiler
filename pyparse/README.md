# pyparse: A parser for Python

In this project, the objective is to construct a parser for Python that takes
as input the output of the lexer.

It is recommended that you accomplish this using Racket's parsing tools and the
providing parsing tool, which can translate a high-level grammar into a format
suitable for use with Racket's parsing tools.
